\section{Defining the neutrino floor/fog by discovery potential}
\label{sec:neutrinofloor}

\subsection{``Standard'' scattering}
Clearly set out a canonical definition of the neutrino floor/fog/whatever so that we are explicit in this paper, and hopefully becomes the standard definition in the community. Should be independent of technology (other than target isotope) and independent of threshold if possible. 

E.g., the floor is defined by where the discoverable cross section is reduced by a factor of N relative to a neutrinoless experiment. By a definition like this, other technologies like directional detectors don't push ``below the floor'' or ``through the fog'' but move the floor to a lower point.

Include current and projected points for existing/funded experiments. The point of this plot is to show in a very concrete way how close current technologies are to being neutrino-limited, no matter how abstractly the floor is defined.}

\subsection{Relating the neutrino floor to EFT couplings}
Highlight EFT couplings that produce signal shapes very different from solar neutrino spectrum, allowing currently-mature-technology detector probe cross sections below the generic spin-dependent neutrino floor.
