\section{Experimental sensitivity}
\label{sec:experiment}

Emphasize discovery potential, not just exclusion sensitivity. May be difficult to combine predictions since some collaborations tend to use exclusion-only predictions e.g. SuperCDMS optimal interval. 

\subsection{Prospects for reaching the neutrino fog}
What are the challenges, R\&D needs for mature technologies to reach the neutrino floor?  Are there any new technologies sensitive to this space that can potentially overcome some of these challenges, and might be competitive with the more mature technologies with sufficient investment?

%Prisca: What would be the umbrella theory here?  Perhaps that belongs in the motivation area of the introduction and we should nest the theory with the type of search (e.g. NR, ER scattering, ER absorption, Dark sector, etc) OR are you imagining that this is basically just a laundry list of what might be searched for?

\subsection{New technologies to push below the neutrino fog}
What is the timescale on which the currently mature technologies might reach the neutrino floor? This sets the timescale by which mature sub-fog technology needs to be developed, which in turn sets the timescale to start heavily prioritizing R\&D.
