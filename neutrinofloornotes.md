## Notes from 2022-02-04 discussion
- What if anything do we want to say about electronic signals (Migdal, DM-electron scattering)?
  - e.g. is Migdal DM-nucleus sensitivity limited by CEvNS-Migdal emission or nu-e scattering?
  - Prescribed method should have obvious way to extend to e.g. EFT couplings, even if we don't explicitly provide those plots
  - 
- reference phystat-dm whitepaper on neutrino uncertainties
- Assumes other backgrounds are understood and properly modeled
- What do we want say about detector characteristics? 
  - limits are largely insensitive to lower threshold
  - talk about resolution?
