\subsection{Landscape of theories proposing particle dark matter}
10,000 foot overview of theories that predict dark matter particles in this mass range. Note any interesting properties of the predicted particles, e.g., requires spin-dependent or EFT coupling, Can we say something about their preferred cross-section ranges in a finite number of plots?

    \begin{tabular}{lcl}
    Theory name & Mass range & Notes \\ \hline
    Theory A & 1-1000 & \\
    Theory B & 0.01-10 &  only axial-vector couplings permited \\

\subsection{Complementary searches?}
Very short section on accelerator and atmospheric complementarity.
