abstract = {Results are presented from the first underground data run of ZEPLIN-II, a 31kg two-phase xenon detector developed to observe nuclear recoils from hypothetical weakly interacting massive dark matter particles. Discrimination between nuclear recoils and background electron recoils is afforded by recording both the scintillation and ionisation signals generated within the liquid xenon, with the ratio of these signals being different for the two classes of event. This ratio is calibrated for different incident species using an AmBe neutron source and 60Co γ-ray sources. From our first 31 live days of running ZEPLIN-II, the total exposure following the application of fiducial and stability cuts was 225kg×days. A background population of radon progeny events was observed in this run, arising from radon emission in the gas purification getters, due to radon daughter ion decays on the surfaces of the walls of the chamber. An acceptance window, defined by the neutron calibration data, of 50\% nuclear recoil acceptance between 5keVee and 20keVee, had an observed count of 29 events, with a summed expectation of 28.6±4.3 γ-ray and radon progeny induced background events. These figures provide a 90\% c.l. upper limit to the number of nuclear recoils of 10.4 events in this acceptance window, which converts to a WIMP–nucleon spin-independent cross-section with a minimum of 6.6×10−7pb following the inclusion of an energy-dependent, calibrated, efficiency. A second run is currently underway in which the radon progeny will be eliminated, thereby removing the background population, with a projected sensitivity of 2×10−7pb for similar exposures as the first run.}

In this paper we present a detailed description of the detector design and present performance results, as established during the commissioning phase and during the first science runs. The active target of XENON100 contains 62kg of LXe, surrounded by an LXe veto of 99kg, both instrumented with photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) operating inside the liquid or in xenon gas. The LXe target and veto are contained in a low-radioactivity stainless steel vessel, embedded in a passive radiation shield and is installed underground at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS), Italy. The experiment has recently published results from a 100 live-days dark matter search. The ultimate design goal of XENON100 is to achieve a spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section sensitivity of σ=2×10−45cm2 for a 100GeV/c2 WIMP.}

abstract = {We report experimental upper limits on WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering cross sections from the second science run of ZEPLIN-III at the Boulby Underground Laboratory. A raw fiducial exposure of 1344 kg⋅days was accrued over 319 days of continuous operation between June 2010 and May 2011. A total of eight events was observed in the signal acceptance region in the nuclear recoil energy range 7–29 keV, which is compatible with background expectations. This allows the exclusion of the scalar cross-section above 4.8×10−8 pb near 50 GeV/c2 WIMP mass with 90\% confidence. Combined with data from the first run, this result improves to 3.9×10−8 pb. The corresponding WIMP-neutron spin-dependent cross-section limit is 8.0×10−3 pb. The ZEPLIN programme reaches thus its conclusion at Boulby, having deployed and exploited successfully three liquid xenon experiments of increasing reach.}

	abstract = {The field of dark matter detection is a highly visible and highly competitive one. In this paper, we propose recommendations for presenting dark matter direct detection results particularly suited for weak-scale dark matter searches, although we believe the spirit of the recommendations can apply more broadly to searches for other dark matter candidates, such as very light dark matter or axions. To translate experimental data into a final published result, direct detection collaborations must make a series of choices in their analysis, ranging from how to model astrophysical parameters to how to make statistical inferences based on observed data. While many collaborations follow a standard set of recommendations in some areas, for example the expected flux of dark matter particles (to a large degree based on a paper from Lewin and Smith in 1995), in other areas, particularly in statistical inference, they have taken different approaches, often from result to result by the same collaboration. We set out a number of recommendations on how to apply the now commonly used Profile Likelihood Ratio method to direct detection data. In addition, updated recommendations for the Standard Halo Model astrophysical parameters and relevant neutrino fluxes are provided. The authors of this note include members of the DAMIC, DarkSide, DARWIN, DEAP, LZ, NEWS-G, PandaX, PICO, SBC, SENSEI, SuperCDMS, and XENON collaborations, and these collaborations provided input to the recommendations laid out here. Wide-spread adoption of these recommendations will make it easier to compare and combine future dark matter results.},

abstract = {The Aria project consists of a plant, hosting a 350 m cryogenic isotopic distillation column, the tallest ever built, which is currently in the installation phase in a mine shaft at Carbosulcis S.p.A., Nuraxi-Figus (SU), Italy. Aria is one of the pillars of the argon dark-matter search experimental program, lead by the Global Argon Dark Matter Collaboration. Aria was designed to reduce the isotopic abundance of 39Ar, a $\beta$-emitter of cosmogenic origin, whose activity poses background and pile-up concerns in the detectors, in the argon used for the dark-matter searches, the so-called Underground Argon (UAr). In this paper, we discuss the requirements, design, construction, tests, and projected performance of the plant for the isotopic cryogenic distillation of argon. We also present the successful results of isotopic cryogenic distillation of nitrogen with a prototype plant, operating the column at total reflux.},

abstract = {Future liquid-argon DarkSide-20k and ARGO detectors, designed for direct dark matter search, will be sensitive also to core-collapse supernova neutrinos, via coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering. This interaction channel is flavor-insensitive with a high-cross section, enabling for a high-statistics neutrino detection with target masses of 50{\textasciitilde}t and 360{\textasciitilde}t for DarkSide-20k and ARGO, respectively. Thanks to the low-energy threshold of 0.5{\textasciitilde}keVnr achievable by exploiting the ionization channel, DarkSide-20k and ARGO have the potential to discover supernova bursts throughout our galaxy and up to the Small Magellanic Cloud, respectively, assuming a 11-M progenitor star. We report also on the sensitivity to the neutronization burst, whose electron neutrino flux is suppressed by oscillations when detected via charged current and elastic scattering. Finally, the accuracies in the reconstruction of the average and total neutrino energy in the different phases of the supernova burst, as well as its time profile, are also discussed, taking into account the expected background and the detector response.},

abstract = {DEAP-3600 is a single-phase liquid argon (LAr) direct-detection dark matter experiment, operating 2 km underground at SNOLAB (Sudbury, Canada). The detector consists of 3279 kg of LAr contained in a spherical acrylic vessel. This paper reports on the analysis of a $758\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{tonne}\ifmmode\cdot\else\textperiodcentered\fi{}\mathrm{day}$ exposure taken over a period of 231 live-days during the first year of operation. No candidate signal events are observed in the WIMP-search region of interest, which results in the leading limit on the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross section on a LAr target of $3.9\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}45}\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{cm}}^{2}$ ($1.5\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}44}\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{cm}}^{2}$) for a $100\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{\mathrm{c}}^{2}$ ($1\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{TeV}/{\mathrm{c}}^{2}$) WIMP mass at 90% C.L. In addition to a detailed background model, this analysis demonstrates the best pulse-shape discrimination in LAr at threshold, employs a Bayesian photoelectron-counting technique to improve the energy resolution and discrimination efficiency, and utilizes two position reconstruction algorithms based on the charge and photon detection time distributions observed in each photomultiplier tube.},

The experimental signature of dark matter interactions is kilo electron volt--scale $^{40}\mathrm{Ar}$ nuclear recoils producing 128 nm LAr scintillation photons observed by photomultiplier tubes. The largest backgrounds in DEAP-3600 are electronic recoils (ERs) induced by $\ensuremath{\beta}$ and $\ensuremath{\gamma}$ rays originating from internal and external radioactivity in the detector material. A background model of the ER interactions in DEAP-3600 was developed and is described in this work. The model is based on several components which are expected from radioisotopes in the LAr, from ex situ material assay measurements, and from dedicated independent in situ analyses. This prior information is used in a Bayesian fit of the ER components to a 247.2 d dataset to model the radioactivity in the surrounding detector materials. Pulse-shape discrimination separates ER and NR events. However, detailed knowledge of the ER background and activity of detector components sets valuable constraints on NR backgrounds including neutrons and alphas. In addition, the activity of $^{42}\mathrm{Ar}$ in LAr in DEAP-3600 is determined by measuring the daughter decay of $^{42}\mathrm{K}$. This cosmogenically activated trace isotope is a relevant background at higher energies for other rare event searches using atmospheric argon, e.g., DarkSide-20k, GERDA, or LEGEND. The specific activity of $^{42}\mathrm{Ar}$ in the atmosphere is found to be $40.4\ifmmode\pm\else\textpm\fi{}5.9\text{ }\text{ }\ensuremath{\mu}\mathrm{Bq}/\mathrm{kg}$ of argon.},

abstract = {This Letter reports the first results of a direct dark matter search with the DEAP-3600 single-phase liquid argon (LAr) detector. The experiment was performed 2 km underground at SNOLAB (Sudbury, Canada) utilizing a large target mass, with the LAr target contained in a spherical acrylic vessel of 3600 kg capacity. The LAr is viewed by an array of PMTs, which would register scintillation light produced by rare nuclear recoil signals induced by dark matter particle scattering. An analysis of 4.44 live days (fiducial exposure of 9.87 ton day) of data taken during the initial filling phase demonstrates the best electronic recoil rejection using pulse-shape discrimination in argon, with leakage ${\&}lt;1.2\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}7}$ (90% C.L.) between 15 and $31\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{keV}}_{ee}$. No candidate signal events are observed, which results in the leading limit on weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP)-nucleon spin-independent cross section on argon, ${\&}lt;1.2\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}44}\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{cm}}^{2}$ for a $100\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{c}^{2}$ WIMP mass (90% C.L.).},

abstract = {The spherical acrylic vessel that contains the liquid argon target is the most critical detector component in the DEAP-3600 dark matter experiment. Alpha decays near the inner surface of the acrylic vessel are one of the main sources of background in the detector. A fraction of the alpha energy, or the recoiling nucleus from the alpha decay, could misreconstruct in the fiducial volume and result in a false candidate dark matter event. Acrylic has low levels of inherent contamination from 238U and 232Th. Another background of particular concern is diffusion of 222Rn during manufacturing, leading to 210Pb contamination. The maximum acceptable concentrations in the DEAP-3600 acrylic vessel are ppt levels of 238U and 232Th equivalent, and 10{\textminus}8 ppt 210Pb. The impurities in the bulk acrylic will be measured by vaporizing a large quantity of acrylic and counting the concentrated residue with ultra-low background HPGe detectors and a low background alpha spectrometer. An overview of the acrylic assay technique is...},
