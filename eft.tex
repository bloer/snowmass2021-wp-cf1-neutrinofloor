\subsection{EFT couplings}
Lead: David Cerdeno

For the N most basic EFT couplings, What is the currently-excluded cross section from published results?  \textbf{Is there a mass range that is not being probed in one or more couplings?} Are there new technologies that uniquely address some portion of this parameter space?

% Prisca: I suppose our charge is to the neutrino floor. Are ER searches the only thing getting there (under our charge)?   Do we cover only electron scattering (elastic and inelastic) and NOT dark sector stuff and dark photon absorption?   What about getting to the neutrino floor at low mass? This is kind of interesting, because the neutrino floor focus could move the discussion away from pushing to the lowest threshold and open up and interesting examination of what the real limit is to low mass at the largest exposures. Thus, a better organizational principle might be for mass regions instead of NR vs ER.  The theory might be easier to subdivide, too.   But if not, I tried to subdivide ER without low mass.
