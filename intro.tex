\subsection{Scope of this paper}
Reach of experimental particle dark-matter searches limited by exposure time and/or backgrounds, but not threshold. The low end of the mass range is roughly 1 MeV WIMPs; the next generation of detectors will have sub-electron resolution; different technology is needed to reach lower threshold. Nuclear recoil sensitivity above $\sim$1~GeV is similarly not strongly dependent on detector threshold.
