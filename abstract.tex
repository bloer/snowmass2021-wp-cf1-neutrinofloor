We present a summary of future prospects for direct detection of dark matter within the GeV/$c^2$ to TeV/$c^2$ mass range. This is paired with a new definition of the neutrino fog in order to better quantify the rate of diminishing returns on sensitivity due to irreducible neutrino backgrounds. A survey of dark matter candidates predicted to fall within this mass range demonstrates that fully testing multiple well-motivated theories will require expanding the currently-funded generation of experiments down to and past the neutrino fog. We end with the status and plans for next-generation experiments and novel R\&D concepts which will get us there.
